# Analyzing dataset of WES(whole exome sequencing) result of 10 pancreatic cancer patients

10 genes which are typically driver mutated in pancreatic cancer: **KRAS**, **TP53**, **TGFB1**, **TGFBR2**, **CDKN2A**, **STK11IP**, **SMAD4**, **BRCA1**, **APC**, **PALB2**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
d<-read_excel("~/Downloads/Pancreatic Cancer All Cell Lines_HIGH,MODERATE_DUP REMOVED.xlsx")
d<-as_tibble(d)
```


```{r}
gene<-c("^KRAS$","^TP53$", "^TGFB1$", "^TGFBR2$","^CDKN2A$","^STK11IP$","^SMAD4$","^BRCA1$","^APC$", "^PALB2$")
a<-grep(paste(gene, collapse="|"),d$Gene_Name)
```

```{r}
